Title: Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

Abstract:
Sentiment analysis is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and categorizing the sentiment expressed in textual data. This project analyzes customer reviews to determine whether they exhibit positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Using a dataset of restaurant reviews sourced from this repository("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skathirmani/datasets/refs/heads/main/restaurant_reviews.csv"), the analysis employs text preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization. Subsequently, machine learning models are developed and evaluated to classify the sentiments. The results provide actionable insights into customer feedback, helping businesses enhance their decision-making and improve customer satisfaction.
